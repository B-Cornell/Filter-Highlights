# Filter-Highlights

This applet is designed to sort text in images by highlighted color. 
The applet works by using the Google Cloud Vision API to read the text in the image.
It then runs the API again to detirmine what color the word is highlighted.
Words are then sorted by color using python. 
This allows users to highlight documents and then upload a picture to get an instantly organized electronic copy of any important text.
